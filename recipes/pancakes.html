    <h2>What You Will Be Eating</h2>
    <p>A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>3½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
